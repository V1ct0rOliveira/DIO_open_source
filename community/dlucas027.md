# New Beginning!

My name is Matheus de Lucas Arouca, I'm 24 years old, and I'm in the process of career migration. I'm currently doing an internship in computer networks where I don't use tools like Git and GitHub frequently, but I'm learning to use them more as I intend to trabalhar na área de desenvolvimento.
